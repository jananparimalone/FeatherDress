# FeatherDress
This is the Python code for a feather dress art/design project with 6 moving servo motors, I run it directly on my Raspberry Pi terminal with the bread board hooked up to it and linked to the motors in order for them to rotate the feathers in on the dress

It was created for the Art of Computation show the CS club was assisting with at SUNY Poly. In order to use this code please ensure you have matched the GPIO output numbers to the correlating ones on your personal bread board before running.
